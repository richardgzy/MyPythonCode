    "* You must work on this assignment individually.\n",
    "* This assignment contributes 20% towards your mark in FIT5211.\n",
    "* The subjects are graphs and spanning trees.\n",
    "* The exercises are roughly given by increasing difficulty.\n",
    "* You may use functions defined in any part of the assignment if that helps. It is thus strongly recommended to first complete Question 1, in case some of those algorithms happen to be useful later on.\n",
    "* You may create auxiliary/helper functions for each question, as long as you use the pre-defined function.\n",
    "* For this assignment, the assertions have not been provided. We strongly recommend you build your own assertions and include them in the notebook you will submit.\n",
    "* All answers in free text format (e.g. Question 3.a) must be justified.\n",
    "* The expected deliverable is this Jupyter Notebook, completed with your answers.\n",
    "* For questions on this assigment, please use the Moodle forum http://moodle.vle.monash.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=3856505.\n",
    "* It is a university requirement (http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/801845/Student-Academic-Integrity_Managing-Plagiarism-and-Collusion-Procedures.pdf) to submit a coversheet (http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/resources/student/forms/) for each assessment item. \n",

At each recursive call, call the function solveMCST to obtain an MCST, which will help decide if and how to further recurse. Check if the MCST given by solveMCST is a valid solution to MCSTBD. If so, this is the base case, and there is no need to further recurse. Otherwise, choose a vertex $v$ such that $degree(v) > k$ in the MCST solution. For each edge $e$ incident to $v$ and currently in the MCST solution, make a recursive call where this edge cannot be selected to be part of a spanning tree (how to handle and store this information is for you to decide)."
